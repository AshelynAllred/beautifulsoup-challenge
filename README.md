I used the starter files provided by BCS and followed the rubric for guidance, but all the work within (aside from pre-filled setup code) is my own and exclusively references either my own notes or basic syntax research online. 

I briefly looked into quantitative analysis on the Mars temperature graphs to find the period of a year, but decided against implementing it because it wasn't necessary for the challenge. That said, from what I saw, there are some super cool signal analysis functions you can use with numpy and scipi; I will definitely keep those in my back pocket.
